# Troubleshooting

Here are the most general rules for troubleshooting:

- Confirm your settings are valid, especially your game dump.
- If a problem happens when installing a mod, check whether it happens to other
  mods and, if so, whether it is all of them or if there seems to be something
  they have in common.
- Read over all the docs that look remotely relevant to your problem.
- If you need help, there are two main places to go:
    - If you think the problem is probably with your own settings, a specific
      mod or mods, or anything else that could be solved without patching UKMM,
      go to [my Discord server](https://discord.gg/y7VJqMB329).
    - If you think the problem is probably with UKMM itself and would require
      changes to the code, [file an issue on
      GitHub](https://github.com/NiceneNerd/ukmm/issues/new/choose).
- In case the program crashes completely, run it from a terminal/Command Prompt
  and check for panic output.

Solutions to some known problems follow:

## The UI is scaled badly and unusable.

This happens on some systems, *particularly Steam Deck*, for unknown reasons,
but can be fixed by setting the environment variable
`WINIT_X11_SCALE_FACTOR=1.0`.
