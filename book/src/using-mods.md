# Using Mods

So, you have everything set up. How does using mods actually work now?

1. Add mods to your current profile. You can add mods in one of three ways,
   which are functionally identical:
    - Click the Open Modâ€¦ button in the File menu.
    - Click the Open icon in the Install tab.
    - Select the mod in the Install tab's file browser.

   > **Note**: 
   > UKMM supports installing mods in three formats:
   > - Mods packaged by UKMM (obviously)
   > - BCML 3 BNPs
   > - Graphic pack/RomFS mods
   >
   > Note that for graphic pack or RomFS mods, the folder structure needs to match
   > what is described in the [UKMM mod format](mod_format.md) instructions. By
   > default UKMM will try to read any relevant metadata from a `rules.txt` or
   > `info.json` file, but if those are absent it will prompt for the basic
   > information.

2. Enable any mods you are ready to use. Mods start disabled until you check the
   box.

3. Click the Apply button in the Pending Changes window to apply your current
   mod configuration. All game files affected by the changes to your mod setup
   will be reprocessed and merged afresh.

4. If you have don't automatic deployment turned on, click the Deploy button in
   the Deploy tab to export the finished mod pack to its intended destination.

5. If you are a console user (or doing something else different), move or copy
   the deployed mods to their final destination (such an SD card set up for
   SDCafiine for Wii U or LayeredFS for Switch)

For Cemu users, auto deploy is recommended and the destination is usually a
specific graphic pack folder, in which case your usual process will be only 1-3.

This is the basic workflow. More details will be addressed where relevant. For
information about how to use SDCafiine or LayeredFS to apply your mods on
console, check [the guide on
ZeldaMods](https://zeldamods.org/wiki/Help:Using_mods).
