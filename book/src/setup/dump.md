# Dumping Your Game

One of the most important (and most lamented) prerequisites for BOTW mod management is to have a copy of your game ROM on your PC. For emulator users (Cemu, Yuzu, or Ryujinx), this is usually already the case, but for console-only players it can be more difficult.

*You must have a modded/hacked console to dump your game.* If you do not have a modded console, you cannot legally acquire a game dump to use with UKMM.

UKMM supports only the latest version of BOTW (1.5.0 on Wii U or 1.6.0 on Switch). Supported formats include:

- Unpacked MLC ![Wii U](../images/u.png) or RomFS ![Switch](../images/nx.png) dump
- ![Wii U](../images/u.png) WUA (aka [ZArchive](https://github.com/Exzap/ZArchive), Cemu-specific)
- ~~![Switch](../images/nx.png) NSP~~ (in progress)
