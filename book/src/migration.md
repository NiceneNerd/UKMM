# Migrating from BCML

For BCML users, a lot of the experience of UKMM should be familiar, but there
are some important differences. For a smoother transition, keep the following in
mind:

- You can attempt to import your BCML settings and mods by clicking Migrate from
  BCML in the settings tab.
- The merge and deploy process in UKMM is just plain different from BCML, though
  it can be setup to work functionally the same way. For more information on
  this, read over [the deployment page](setup/deploy.md).
- For mod developers: ***do not attempt to edit UKMM ZIPs directly***. I know
  this was common in some circles with BNPs, but this will generally not work,
  will probably break your mod, and is officially frowned upon.
