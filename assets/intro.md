# Welcome to UKMM

Greetings. It appears this is the first time you have run UKMM. In order to do
much of anything, you should first run to the Settings tab to configure
everything. If you need help with that, check out the docs, which should be
detailed enough to get you through. (Where are the docs? There's a Help button
on the Settings tab.)

I hope you shall enjoy using UKMM. If you like it, consider subscribing to my
Patreon or donating a little crypto so that all the time I've been spending on
this won't feel (to myself or to my wife) like a waste.
