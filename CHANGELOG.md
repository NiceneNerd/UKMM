# Changelog

All notable changes to UKMM will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

- **Breaking change**: Updated to the newest version of roead, which supports
  BYML versions 5-7. This means *all mods that edit BYML files* may need to be
